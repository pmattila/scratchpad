# Rotorflight

Rotorflight is Flight Control software (firmware) for single-rotor helicopters.

It is based on Betaflight 4.2, with many advanced features added for helicopters.
Rotorflight does *NOT* support multi-rotor crafts, nor airplanes; it is only for helicopters.

## Important Notice: It is highly recommended to use a STM32F7 based flight controller, as Rotorflight greatly benefits from the latest filtering algorithms and other new features.

## Support and Developers Channel

There's a dedicated Slack chat channel here:

https://slack.betaflight.com/

Etiquette: Don't ask to ask and please wait around long enough for a reply - sometimes people are out flying, asleep or at work and can't answer immediately.

## Configuration Tool

To configure Betaflight you should use the Betaflight-configurator GUI tool (Windows/OSX/Linux) which can be found here:

https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator/releases/latest

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and encouraged. You can contribute in many ways:

* implement a new feature in the firmware or in configurator (see [below](#Developers));
* documentation updates and corrections;
* How-To guides - received help? Help others!
* bug reporting & fixes;
* new feature ideas & suggestions;
* provide a new translation for configurator, or help us maintain the existing ones (see [below](#Translators)).

The best place to start is the Betaflight Slack (registration [here](https://slack.betaflight.com/)). Next place is the github issue tracker:

https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/issues
https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator/issues

Before creating new issues please check to see if there is an existing one, search first otherwise you waste people's time when they could be coding instead!

## Developers

Contribution of bugfixes and new features is encouraged. Please be aware that we have a thorough review process for pull requests, and be prepared to explain what you want to achieve with your pull request.
Before starting to write code, please read our [development guidelines](docs/development/Development.md ) and [coding style definition](docs/development/CodingStyle.md).

## Translators

We want to make Betaflight accessible for pilots who are not fluent in English, and for this reason we are currently maintaining translations into 18 languages for Betaflight Configurator: Català, Deutsch, Español, Euskera, Français, Galego, Hrvatski, Bahasa Indonesia, Italiano, 日本語, 한국어, Latviešu, Português, Português Brasileiro, polski, Русский язык, Svenska, 简体中文.
We have got a team of volunteer translators who do this work, but additional translators are always welcome to share the workload, and we are keen to add additional languages. If you would like to help us with translations, you have got the following options:
- if you help by suggesting some updates or improvements to translations in a language you are familiar with, head to [crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/betaflight-configurator) and add your suggested translations there;
- if you would like to start working on the translation for a new language, or take on responsibility for proof-reading the translation for a language you are very familiar with, please head to the Betaflight Slack (registration [here](https://slack.betaflight.com/)), and join the '#team\_translation' channel - the people in there can help you to get a new language added, or set you up as a proof reader.
